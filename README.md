# slock 

**Welcome to my slock config!**

❤️ Thanks to [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/) to make wonderful programs. ❤️

### **Helpers**

I have made scripts to automate the process of creating/applying patches. The scripts can be found in my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/Mageas/dotfiles/-/tree/master/root/usr/bin).

List and uses of the scripts:
- **suckclean** Remove all the branches, but master.
- **suckdiff** Create a diff file for each branch (You can add a header in `patches/headers`).
- **suckload** Create git branch for each diff file.
- **suckupdate** Load diff files, then make and clean the git repo.
