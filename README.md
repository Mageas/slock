### **Helpers**

I have made scripts to automate the process of creating/applying patches. Scripts can be found in my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/Mageas/dotfiles).

How to use helpers scripts:
- **[suckupdate](https://github.com/Mageas/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/.local/bin/suckupdate)** Build the suckless repository with your patches.
- **[suckload](https://github.com/Mageas/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/.local/bin/suckload)** Load your patches in separate git branches.
- **[suckdiff](https://github.com/Mageas/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/.local/bin/suckdiff)** Save your changes in the `patches` directory (You can add a header in `patches/headers`).
- **[suckclean](https://github.com/Mageas/dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/.local/bin/suckclean)** Clean your repository.
